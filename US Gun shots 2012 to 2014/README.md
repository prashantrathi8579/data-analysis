## Analysis done on US gun shot deaths between 2012 to 2014

- Basic python is used to complete the analysis.

- github parses .csv and jupyter notebooks. So, user can directly click and view any of the attached file.

- This analysis expects user to know basic python and basic understanding of jupyter notebook to get the flow and cells in  US_Gun_Shot_Deaths_Analysis_2012_2014.ipynb file.

- Uploaded files can be used or downloaded for further analysis or personal understanding.

- Data is taken from __[fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data)__ and stored in guns.csv file.

- If user is downloading files to work locally then download all three files at single folder for commands to run without modifying the attached .ipynb file.

- Analysis can be extended with more combinations of data.

- Suggestions are welcome
